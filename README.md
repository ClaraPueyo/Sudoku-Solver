# Sudoku-Solver

This program solves a Sudoku Puzzle, imported by a .txt file where ";" are the cells that should be completed in the game. It is based on an backtracking algorithm that stops at the empty cells in an orderly way, filling in digits sequentially, or backtracking when the number is found to be not valid.
